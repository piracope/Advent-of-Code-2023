# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code, 2023 edition.

They... they probably suck tbh, end of semester is hitting pretty hard
and to be fair I don't really want to take a lot of time to
find out the most efficient solution, I just want to get it done.

## Languages

I think I'll start out with C#, never used it before. Will maybe use
something else idk.
